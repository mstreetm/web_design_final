            <p>Coding is not only a useful skill; learning to code can present a variety of opportunities to advance in life.  It can teach you problem-solving skills and critical thinking.  It could let create that cool app you have been thinking about, or help you create a website to draw more people into your next flash mob. Learning to code would give you the ability to automate that one task you absolutely hate doing.</p>
            <p>Coding is for anyone and everyone, not only middle-aged white men that still live in their parents’ basement.  Women, children, teenagers, grandparents, even George the trash dude and your neighbor Azim.  If learning to code was a board game, it would be rated ages 4-104, and available in all languages.  Learning to code can open up all sorts of doors that were never even visible before, and all it takes is a bit of time, and a willingness to learn.</p>

            <p>Learning to code is fun! It helps you learn to solve problems, and at the end, you get this thing that you built.  You learn that computers will do whatever you tell them to do, and that you can tell them to do anything.  You learn to take a challenge, something that you never thought you would be able to do, and break it down into pieces that you can do.  Learning to code opens up a world of opportunities that you never even imagined.  It teaches you to go from “I don’t know how to do this” to “I can do this”.  If this sounds interesting to you, then you should learn to code.</p>

            <p>Programming is a male-dominated industry, but we can change that.  There are more than twice as many men than women in the tech industry, and that makes it seem that coding is not a thing that women should learn to do.  But coding is for everyone, not just white men.  No matter who you are, you can learn to code.  You can do anything that you set your mind to, even if society thinks it is “not your place”.  Break societal norms and learn to code.  The toch industry needs a more diverse workforce, and if you want to be a part of that, learn to code.</p>
